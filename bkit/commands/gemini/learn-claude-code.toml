# Claude Code Learning Guide

Educates users on how to configure Claude Code. Works **across any project, any language**.

## Usage

```
/learn-claude-code [level]
```

- If level is omitted: Analyzes current settings and recommends appropriate level
- If level specified: 1 (basics), 2 (automation), 3 (specialization), 4 (team optimization)

## Why This Command?

```
Problem: Need to re-explain Claude Code usage every new session
Solution: Provide consistent education through this command
```

## Tasks Performed

### Step 1: Analyze Current Settings

Analyze the project's Claude Code configuration status:

```bash
# Files/folders to check
- CLAUDE.md (root)
- .claude/settings.local.json
- .claude/commands/
- .claude/agents/
- .claude/skills/
- .mcp.json
- .github/workflows/claude-docs-update.yml
```

### Step 2: Determine User Level

| Level | Condition | Learning Content |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | No CLAUDE.md | Basics: How to write CLAUDE.md, Plan Mode |
| 2 | Only CLAUDE.md | Automation: Commands, Hooks, Permission management |
| 3 | Commands/Hooks exist | Specialization: Agents, Skills, MCP |
| 4 | Most settings complete | Team Optimization: GitHub Action, Team rules |

### Step 3: Provide Educational Content

#### Level 1: Basics (15 min)

```markdown
## What is CLAUDE.md?

It's your team's shared knowledge repository. When Claude makes mistakes,
add rules so the same mistakes aren't repeated.

## Example

# Development Workflow

## Package Management
- **Always use `pnpm`** (`npm`, `yarn` prohibited)

## Coding Conventions
- Prefer `type`, avoid `interface`
- **Never use `enum`** → Use string literal unions

## Prohibited
- ❌ No console.log (use logger)
- ❌ No any type

## Practice

Create CLAUDE.md right now!
```

#### Level 2: Automation (30 min)

```markdown
## What are Slash Commands?

Execute repetitive daily tasks with `/command-name`.

## Command Location

.claude/commands/{command-name}.md

## PostToolUse Hook

Automatically run formatting after code modifications.

// .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "pnpm format || true"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

#### Level 3: Specialization (45 min)

```markdown
## What are Sub-agents?

AI agents specialized for specific tasks.

## What are Skills?

Domain-specific expert contexts. Claude automatically references them for related work.

## MCP Connection

Connect external tools (Slack, GitHub, Jira, etc.) via .mcp.json.
```

#### Level 4: Team Optimization (1 hour)

```markdown
## Automate PRs with GitHub Action

Mention @claude in PR comments to automatically update documentation.

## Team Rule Standardization

1. Manage CLAUDE.md with Git
2. Add rules during PR reviews
3. Gradually accumulate team knowledge
```

### Step 4: Guide to Next Level

After completing current level, guide to proceed to next level.

## Output

```
📚 Claude Code Learning Complete!

**Current Level**: {level}
**Learned**: {summary}

🎯 Next Steps:
- Continue learning with /learn-claude-code {next_level}
- Auto-generate settings with /setup-claude-code
- Check latest trends with /upgrade-claude-code
```

## Level 5: PDCA Methodology (Optional)

```markdown
## What is PDCA?

A document-driven development methodology. Claude applies it automatically.

Plan → Do (Design/Implement) → Check (Analyze) → Act (Improve)

## Core Principles

User: "Create a login feature"
Claude: 1. Check docs/02-design/ → Design first
        2. Generate design document from template
        3. Implement after design approval
        4. Suggest Gap analysis after completion

## Folder Structure

docs/
├── 01-plan/      # Planning
├── 02-design/    # Design
├── 03-analysis/  # Analysis
└── 04-report/    # Reports

## Detailed Learning

Use `/pdca-design`, `/pdca-plan`, `/pdca-analyze` commands to learn PDCA methodology.
