# Pipeline Start

Starts the Development Pipeline guide.

## Execution Content

1. **Project Analysis**
   - Detect current project level (Starter/Dynamic/Enterprise)
   - Check existing progress status

2. **Check User Experience Level**
   - Less development experience: Full 9-phase guide
   - Experienced: Guide only necessary parts
   - Expert: Proceed freely without Pipeline

3. **Start from Phase 1**
   - Guide from schema/terminology definition
   - Apply PDCA cycle at each Phase

## 9 Development Phases

| Phase | Name | Main Tasks |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Schema/Terminology | Define domain terms and data structures |
| 2 | Coding Conventions | Establish code style and rules |
| 3 | Mockup | Create UI prototypes |
| 4 | API Design | Design and implement backend APIs |
| 5 | Design System | Build component library |
| 6 | UI Implementation | Integrate UI with APIs |
| 7 | SEO/Security | Optimize search and security |
| 8 | Review | Verify quality and gaps |
| 9 | Deployment | Deploy to production |

## Reference

- `skills/development-pipeline/`: Complete Pipeline knowledge
- `agents/pipeline-guide.md`: Guide agent
- `templates/pipeline/`: Templates per Phase

## Cautions

Pipeline is an **optional** guide.
- Only applies to development work
- Non-development AI tasks apply only PDCA, not Pipeline
- Experts can freely skip phases
